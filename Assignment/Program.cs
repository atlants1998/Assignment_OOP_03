                What is the primary purpose of an interface in C#? */
            // b) To define a blueprint for a class


            /*Question 2:
                Which of the following is NOT a valid access modifier for interface members in C#? */
            // a) private

            /*Question 3:
                Can an interface contain fields in C#? */
            // b) No


            /*Question 4:
                In C#, can an interface inherit from another interface? */
            // b) Yes, interfaces can inherit from multiple interfaces


            /*Question 5:
                Which keyword is used to implement an interface in a class in C#? */
            // NONE

            /*Question 6: 
                Can an interface contain static methods in C#? */

            /*Question 7:
                In C#, can an interface have explicit access modifiers for its members? */
            // a) To hide the interface members from outside access.

            /*Question 9:
                In C#, can an interface have a constructor? */
            // b) No, interfaces cannot have constructors

            /*Question 10:
                How can a C# class implement multiple interfaces? */
            // c) By separating interface names with commas
